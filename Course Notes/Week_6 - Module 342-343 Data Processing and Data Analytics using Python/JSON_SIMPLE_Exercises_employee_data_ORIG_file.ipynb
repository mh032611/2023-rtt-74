        "**1. Reading JSON Data**:\n",
        "- This code imports the `json` module and uses it to load JSON data from a file called `'data.json'`.\n",
        "- It reads the data from the file using `json.load(json_file)` and stores it in the variable `data`.\n",
        "- Then, it accesses specific information (name, age, email) of the first person in the data and prints them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Count Employees**:\n",
        "- This code uses a list comprehension to count the number of employees from the JSON data.\n",
        "- It iterates through each person in the data, and if the `'is_employee'` key is `True`, the person is considered an employee and added to the `employees` list.\n",
        "- The length of the `employees` list is calculated using `len()` to get the total number of employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Filter by State**:\n",
        "- This code filters people based on a specific state (e.g., \"TX\").\n",
        "- It uses a list comprehension to create a list of people who have an address state that matches the specified state.\n",
        "- It then prints the names of people in the filtered list.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Find Hobbies**:\n",
        "- This code finds all unique hobbies from the JSON data.\n",
        "- It uses a nested list comprehension to iterate through each person and their hobbies, creating a flat list of all hobbies.\n",
        "- The `set()` function is used to convert the list of hobbies into a set of unique hobbies.\n",
        "- The unique hobbies are then printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Age Statistics**:\n",
        "- This code calculates age statistics for people in the JSON data.\n",
        "- It creates a list of ages using a list comprehension.\n",
        "- It calculates the average age, youngest age (using `min()`), and oldest age (using `max()`).\n",
        "- The calculated statistics are printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Update Email**:\n",
        "- This code updates the email address for a specific person (e.g., \"John Doe\").\n",
        "- It iterates through each person and checks if their name matches the target name.\n",
        "- If a match is found, it updates the person's email and then writes the updated data back to the JSON file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Group by City**:\n",
        "- This code groups people by their cities.\n",
        "- It uses a dictionary to store city names as keys and a list of people living in that city as values.\n",
        "- It iterates through each person, extracts their city, and adds their name to the corresponding city list in the dictionary.\n",
        "- It prints the city groups and the people in each city.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. Check Hobbies**:\n",
        "- This code checks if a specific person (e.g., \"Alice Smith\") has a specific hobby (e.g., \"painting\").\n",
        "- It uses the `any()` function with a generator expression to check if the target hobby is in the list of hobbies for the specified person.\n",
        "- The result of the check is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. Calculate Total Addresses**:\n",
        "- This code calculates the total number of unique addresses from the JSON data.\n",
        "- It uses a set to store formatted address strings (combining street, city, state, and zip).\n",
        "- It iterates through each person, formats their address, and adds it to the set.\n",
        "- The length of the set is the total number of unique addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. Sort by Age**:\n",
        "- This code sorts people by age in ascending order.\n",
        "- It uses the `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key to sort the data based on age.\n",
        "- The resulting sorted list is printed, displaying people's names and ages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax Choices**:\n",
        "- The code consistently uses meaningful variable names, making the code easy to understand.\n",
        "- List comprehensions are used for efficient and concise data processing.\n",
        "- Iteration through dictionaries is done using key access (e.g., `person['age']`).\n",
        "- The `with` statement is used to open files, ensuring proper handling and automatic closing.\n",
        "\n",
        "These examples demonstrate various ways the `json` module can be used to manipulate and analyze JSON data in real-world scenarios."
