    "***NOTE*** this is untested:\n",
    "\n",
    "modify the function so that it can be used with any API by passing a base URL and an endpoint as parameters. \n",
    "Here's the updated code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "def fetch_all_records(base_url, endpoint):\n",
    "    all_records = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    url = f\"{base_url}/{endpoint}\"  # Create the complete URL\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while url:\n",
    "        response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "        data = response.json()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Change this line to match the endpoint's key in the response data\n",
    "        all_records.extend(data[f'all_{endpoint}'])  \n",
    "\n",
    "        url = data['info']['next']  # Get URL of next page\n",
    "\n",
    "    return all_records\n",
    "\n",
    "base_url = \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api\"\n",
    "endpoint = \"character\"\n",
    "all_characters = fetch_all_records(base_url, endpoint)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Total {endpoint}s: {len(all_characters)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I've renamed the function to `fetch_all_records` to make it more general and descriptive.\n",
    "2. The function now takes two parameters: `base_url` and `endpoint`. These parameters will allow you to specify the base URL of any API and the specific endpoint you want to fetch.\n",
    "3. Inside the function, I've constructed the complete URL by combining the `base_url` and `endpoint`.\n",
    "4. The line that extends the `all_records` list has been modified to use `data[f'all_{endpoint}']`. This will extract the list of records using a dynamic key based on the endpoint provided. For example, if the endpoint is \"character\", it will use `data['all_character']`.\n",
    "5. The rest of the code remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can use this function to fetch data from any API endpoint by providing the appropriate `base_url` and `endpoint` parameters. Just make sure that the response structure matches the assumed structure (i.e., having a `\"results\"` field and an `\"info\"` field with a `\"next\"` field).\n",

Let's break down what happens in each approach when the `\"next\"` field is `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 1: Using a While Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first approach, when the `\"next\"` field becomes `null`, the `while` loop's condition `while url:` will evaluate to `False`, and the loop will exit. This means that the loop stops iterating, and the function `fetch_characters` returns the complete list of characters that have been fetched from all the paginated pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 2: Using Recursive Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second approach, when the `\"next\"` field is `null`, the recursive function `fetch_characters_recursive` will not make any further calls to itself. The condition `if data['info']['next']:` checks whether the `\"next\"` field exists in the response data. If it does not exist or is `null`, the condition will evaluate to `False`, and the recursion will stop. As a result, the function will return the list of characters collected from all the paginated pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches are designed to handle the scenario when there are no more pages to fetch. They ensure that the code execution stops once all available data has been retrieved from the API.

    "let's break down the purpose of the `2` and `+1` in the `range` function within the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `range` function generates a sequence of numbers, starting from the first argument up to (but not including) the second argument. The `range` function can also take a third argument, which specifies the step size between the numbers. Here's the general syntax of the `range` function:\n",

    "range(start, stop, step)\n",

    "```python\n",
    "for page_num in range(2, total_pages + 1):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2` is the start value for the `range`. We start from page number 2 because we've already fetched data from the first page outside the loop. The loop iterates from page number 2 onwards to the total number of pages.\n",
    "- `total_pages + 1` is the stop value for the `range`. Since the `range` function generates numbers up to, but not including, the stop value, we add `1` to include the total number of pages. For example, if `total_pages` is `42`, this ensures that the loop iterates through pages 2 to 42 (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the `for` loop iterates over the range of page numbers, fetching data for each page and extending the `all_characters` list with the characters from each page. The purpose of the `2` and `+1` is to ensure that we iterate over the correct range of page numbers to fetch data for all available pages while excluding the first page that we already fetched outside the loop."
