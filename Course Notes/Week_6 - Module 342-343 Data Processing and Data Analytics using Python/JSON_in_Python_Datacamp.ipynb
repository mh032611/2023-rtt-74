        "•  In this example, we have a JSON object representing a person with various properties like name, age, hobbies, and address.  \n",
        "•  It defines an object with several key-value pairs.  \n",
        "•  The keys are (MUST BE) strings and the values can be of various types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and nested objects.  \n",
        "•  In this particular example, the object represents a person named John Doe with an age of 30, an email address, and a boolean value indicating whether or not they are an employee.  \n",
        "•  The hobbies property is an array [list] that contains three strings.   \n",
        "•  The address property is an object with several properties consisting of key-value pairs defining their street, city, state, and zip code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Note that JSON data is typically formatted as a series of key-value pairs and are formatted exactly like a Python dictoinary, with the key represented as a string and the value represented in various types such as string, number, boolean, array, or object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The KEY difference (see what i did there?) is that dictionary keys can be any hashable data type -\n",
        "(In the context of dictionaries in programming, the term \"hashable\" refers to an object that has a hash value that remains constant throughout its lifetime. A hash value is a numerical representation generated from the object's data, and it's used by dictionaries and other data structures to quickly look up and access values associated with specific keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hashable keys are crucial for dictionary performance. When you use a hashable object as a key in a dictionary, the dictionary can calculate the hash value of the key and use it to efficiently find the corresponding value without iterating through the entire dictionary.)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quote Usage Json vs dictionary:\n",
        "While JSON enforces the use of double quotes for keys and values, Python dictionaries provide more flexibility by allowing both single and double quotes.\n"

        "Optimizing JSON Performance in Python\n",
        "When working with large amounts of JSON data in Python, optimizing the performance of your code is important to ensure that it runs efficiently. Here are some tips for optimizing JSON performance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the cjson or ujson libraries. These libraries are faster than the standard JSON library in Python and can significantly improve the performance of JSON serialization and deserialization.\n",
        "Avoid unnecessary conversions. Converting back and forth between Python objects and JSON data can be expensive in terms of performance. If possible, try to work directly with JSON data and avoid unnecessary conversions.\n",
        "Use generators for large JSON data. When working with large amounts of JSON data, using generators can help reduce memory usage and improve performance.\n",
        "Minimize network overhead. When transmitting JSON data over a network, minimizing the amount of data transferred can improve performance. Use compression techniques such as gzip to reduce the size of JSON data before transmitting it over a network.\n",
        "Use caching. If you frequently access the same JSON data, caching the data can improve performance by reducing the number of requests to load the data.\n",
        "Optimize data structure: The structure of the JSON data can also impact performance. Using a simpler, flatter data structure can improve performance over a complex, nested structure.\n",
        "Limitations of JSON format\n",
        "While JSON is a popular format for data exchange in many applications, there are some implementation limitations to be aware of:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lack of support for some data types. JSON has limited support for certain data types, such as binary data, dates, and times. While there are workarounds to represent these types in JSON, it can make serialization and deserialization more complicated.\n",
        "Lack of support for comments. Unlike other formats, such as YAML and XML, JSON does not support comments. This can make it harder to add comments to JSON data to provide context or documentation.\n",
        "Limited flexibility for extensions. While JSON does support extensions through custom properties or the $schema property, the format does not provide as much flexibility for extensions as other formats, such as XML or YAML.\n",
        "No standard for preserving key order. JSON does not have a standard way of preserving the order of keys in an object, making it harder to compare or merge JSON objects.\n",
        "Limited support for circular references. JSON has limited support for circular references, where an object refers back to itself. This can make it harder to represent some data structures in JSON.\n",
        "It's important to be aware of these implementation limitations when working with JSON data to ensure that the format is appropriate for your needs and to avoid potential issues with serialization, deserialization, and data representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "JSON is a versatile and widely used format for data exchange in modern web development, and Python provides a powerful set of tools for working with JSON data. Whether you are building an API or working with client-side web applications, understanding the basics of JSON in Python is an essential skill for any modern developer. By mastering the techniques outlined in this tutorial, you will be well on your way to working with JSON data in Python and building robust, scalable applications that leverage the power of this powerful data interchange format.\n",

You’ll use pandas, a major Python library for analytics, to get data from a variety of sources, including a spreadsheet of survey responses, a database of public service requests, and an API for a popular review site."
